Ciao! I’m **Pham Cong Thuong** (you can call me **Elio**) — welcome to my little corner of the internet 👋

I’m a **robotics software engineer** and a long-time **machine learning enthusiast**, currently based in **Genoa, Italy**. Most of my day-to-day work revolves around **vision systems for humanoid robots** — playing with **event cameras, RGB cameras, and LiDAR**, and trying to make machines see the world a bit more like we do.

Lately, I’ve found myself increasingly obsessed with a particular three-pound object that somehow produces thoughts, memories, and curiosity: **the brain** 🧠. I’ve been binge-watching *The Brain* on PBS and reading David Eagleman’s books (*Brain*, *Livewired*), and they’ve completely reshaped how I think about intelligence. With neuroscience, AI, and computational science all colliding, it really feels like we’re standing at the edge of understanding something extraordinary.

This blog is a place where I share thoughts, projects, notes, and curiosities along that journey.
